Important information about your Constant Credit Account Once advances are made from your Constant Credit Account, an INTEREST CHARGE will automatically be imposed on the account's outstanding ""Average daily balance. The INTEREST CHARGE is calculated by applying the ''Daily periodic rate"" to the 'Average daily balance"" of your account (including current transactions) and multiplying this figure by the number of days in the billing cycle. To get the ""Average daily balance,"" we take the beginning account balance each day. add any new advances or debits, and subtract any payments or credits and the last unpaid INTEREST CHARGE. This gives us the daily balance. Then we add all of the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the 'Average daily balance.” Billing Rights Summary In case of errors or questions about your Constant Credit statement If you think your statement is incorrect, or if you need more information about a Constant Credit transaction on your statement, please call 1-800-BANK BBT or visit your local BB&T financial center.
